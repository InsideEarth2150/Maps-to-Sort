Description:
Players start on one of 6 high areas. There are plenty of of areas to expand too, and expanding
will give you a big advantage. The Terrian is rocky, so planes can be very useful. The water 
is outside the map's border, so ships are not buildable. 
----------------------
Installation
To install the map, put the .Ind and .mis files in the C:\programfiles\SSI\earth2150\levels
