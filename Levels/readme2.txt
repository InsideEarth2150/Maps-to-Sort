Commander, a platoon operating in the Rocky Mountains has found a new sector. The area is 
bordered by mountains and a river. In the center of the sector is a large mountain that 
contains rich resources. We believe that it may have lost it's top during the nuclear war.
The mountain is surrounded by a river. The only way in or out is 8 bridges located around
the mountain. The mountain slopes are steep and hard to naviagate. Take the mountain and
fortify it. Then use the resources to destroy any and all enemy units in the area.
