Description              :  Since in most maps the UCS and ED navies are useless or
                                      not as useful as ground and air forces for the amount of
                                      credits expended, I made a map where building navies
                                      would be worthwhile.  The map is mostly water with four
                                      unconnected islands with most of the land area within range
                                      of ships' weapons (rockets).
