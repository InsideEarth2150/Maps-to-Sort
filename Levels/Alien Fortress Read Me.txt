Alien Fortress Read Me File

This map is set up for 1 person to challange up to 12 other players (computer or Human)
It is a huge map. In the Center is where the Alien Fortress was discovered by a research team; they even left their equipment behind for you (some buildings & units). The building
were found to be useless (to complex to opperate). But the units left there were in usable
shape and are at your disposal. But the enemy found out and have sent 12 squads to try to
stop you. The aliens even left some undiscovered wealth for you to find.
You must use map defaults to see the alien fortress and have the additional units.
by the way the alien fortress building are yours to defend also, if destroyed, they
count against your score.

This was done by giving LC building to a UCS player. The game won't let you use the buildings.

Optional 6 vs 6 game odds vs. evens - no number 1 player.
