Notes:
Players fight in a island area. A resource rich island is in the middle. Boats can be very 
useful.

Installation
To install the map, put the .Ind and .mis files in the C:\programfiles\SSI\earth2150\levels
directory. You may have to create a levels directory in the earth2150 folder. I'm not sure,
i didn't check it out before i made the map.
