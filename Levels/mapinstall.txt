~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the map(s), make a folder in the Earth 2150 directory named "Levels" (without quotation marks). The Earth 2150 directory is usually located at: C:\Program Files\SSI\Earth 2150\.
The zip file you download contains at least two files. The extensions on these files are .lnd and .mis. After unzipping them, cut and paste them into the "Levels" folder.
You're done! Play the game!
