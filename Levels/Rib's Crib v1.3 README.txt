Rib's Crib v1.3

__________________________________________________
Latest additions:  Formatted README, revisions on 
creek, and modification of resource fields.  They 
are now P.C., & unfortunately a bit smaller.  I 
recommend setting resources higher than normal.  
--------------------------------------------------
Well, modifications include improved creek (bridges 
are the only throughpoints), ornamentation, and 3D-
ishness.  Also, each side is more varied as far as 
balance.  Resources are the same, and this map 
isn't playtested enough.

--------------------------------------------------
This is a North-South game with limited space. 
Designed for rushing.  Resource Fields are on the
left and right in addition to the center starting 
point.  The gamble is to prepare bases that can 
gather resources, or prepare early for a rush.  
Be advised that there is a small pass in the 
middle of the map, so the bridges are not the 
only access points to the other side.  Crater on 
the North side is intended for the Lunar 
Corporation, as they have landed on the field and 
prepare to sweep the South.  No tunnels, and 
simple ground layout.  
Get them before they get you.
