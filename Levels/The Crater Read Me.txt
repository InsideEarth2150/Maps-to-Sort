The Crater Read Me File

This map has multiple play scenarios.

The first is an all out 8 player game of "death match" - do not use players 9 - 13
     Optional players 9-12 can be computers (poor for players due to terrain)
The second is team play 1 & 5, 2 & 6, 3 & 7, 4 & 8 or odds VS evens (up to 8)
     plus you still can have 4 computers for 9-12
The third is 1 vs. 12; he starts out in the middle of the crater. Excellent to test your
     skills with.

The Crater is surrounded by a river (caused by the meteorite). But it is rich in deposits
     both around it and in the center.
The corners of the map are used for possible computer players, the deposits and much of
     land are cover by woods here.
The resources are plenty with out being to much. Many are hidden in forests, so blowing away 
     trees is a necessity.

Have Fun.
