NOTES:  Resource fields have been placed neareach start point, though the deposits are small.  
I have included enough to start each faction. You will find additional resources, as well as
other game sustaining items throughout the map. Each player has ample chance to claim what 
is needed to win.  This is the first of a three map set. 


You MUST have at least 128 MB(recommended 192MB) RAM and a video card with 32MB video RAM in 
order to see all of the features on this map.  Those playing this map, with less than that listed, 
may experience frequent crashes.  
This map is a hog, as far as system resources go.  For first play, I would take it very slow, and just
travel around the map a little so that you know where things are, and how to get around.  If you feel
like it, open it up in the editor and have a look at what's there.  That way, when you play, you can 
see if everything is showing up. 

How-to's will be posted for some of the map features on my map shots page.  You can get there by
following the link(s) I've placed in my entries in Earth Orbiter News(http://everything.at/earth2150).
