SITUATION:  The Eagle Has Landed !  You have embarked on a quest to take Lunar Base Seven One and clear the surrounding area
of ALL enemy forces.            

ORDER OF BATTLE:  This is LC home turf, the Moon. Move forward toward the abandoned base area.  A single bridge will get 
you accross the deep chasm that surrounds your objective.  Watch towers are accessible to your units, and may give you
added visibility of the surrounding terrain. If the bridge somehow falls into enemy hands, or perhaps to strengthen your
hold on the base, blow the bridge. Engineering assets will help you reconstruct the bridge AND give you access to the
 underground layer where there is a prison complex FILLED with surprises(if you play on map default).

NOTES:  Many of the features you see on this map will be explained in tutorials which I will post on my maps 
web page.  See Earth Orbiter for the link. http://everything.at/earth2150
