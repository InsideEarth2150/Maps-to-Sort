SITUATION:  This desolate mix of highly dissected mountainous terrain and wind-blown plains rests along the Drina river.
Perhaps at the onset of a prior battle, a trench was dug along the banks of the river which could lend some cover to 
units in and around a gutted town... a town whose name has been long since forgotten.  Rumor has it that there are 
sizeable caches of money, technology and other valuables in the area.  UCS, ED and minor elements of LC forces have been 
seen in the area.  

ORDER OF BATTLE: The condition of the bridges crossing the Drina River is suspect.  The use of Engineering assets, with 
bridging hardware, is advisable. Erosion has affected the trench in places, making crossings possible with engineering 
support. To thwart early incursions of enemy ground forces into friendly territory, the bridges may be blown using any 
means necessary. Resource veins appear on the river island, in and near the town, in some of the surrounding mountains, 
and in the plains.  Mining and harvesting units should range far and wide across the battlefield. 

NOTES:  If you want to be dramatic and take out the bridges and/or put them back, I'd advise that you keep up with r
esearches.  Some targetable heavy weapons and/or bombers may prove useful.
