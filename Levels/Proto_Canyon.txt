Map Information .
***************************************************
Thanx for downloading my map this is probably my favourite one at 
the moment .
It’s set in the desert and i have tried to make it as 3D as possible .
There is a river which runs along the left and top which has paths 
and mountains on all sides .
The paths fork into cliff side passes which should be good for
ambushes and attacks from above .
There is also a base in the middle which has a railroad which goes 
north over the river .
This game would make for a good tactical game due to the maze 
like way it is .
